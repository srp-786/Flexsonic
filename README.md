## About the Project

### Aim  
FlexSonic aims to bridge the communication gap for speech-impaired individuals by converting hand gestures into audible phrases.

### Description  
The glove uses **flex sensors** (to detect finger bending) and an **MPU6050 IMU** (to capture orientation). Sensor data is processed on an **ESP32**, which runs a simple **ML model (K-Means clustering)** to classify gestures. The recognized gesture is mapped to a **pre-recorded audio file** on a **DFPlayer Mini**, producing real-time speech output through a speaker.  

## Tech Stack

**Hardware:**  
- ESP32  
- Flex Sensors  
- MPU6050  
- DFPlayer Mini  
- Speaker  
- SD Card  

**Software:**  
- Arduino IDE / PlatformIO (ESP32 firmware)  
- C / Embedded C for driver code  
- Python (for ML model training & testing)
- ML Libraries: scikit-learn

**Frameworks/Tools:**  
- FreeRTOS (ESP32 task scheduling)  
- I²C, UART communication protocols

```
## Getting Started  

### Prerequisites  
```
- **ESP-IDF v4.0+** (or Arduino IDE with ESP32 boards installed)  
- **Python 3.8+**  
```
**Required libraries (Arduino/ESP32):**  
- `esp32` board support package  
- `Adafruit_MPU6050`  
- `DFRobotDFPlayerMini`  

## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/flexsonic.git
cd flexsonic
```
## Usage

Follow these steps to run and test the project:

1. **Connect Hardware**
   - Attach all flex sensors to the ESP32.
   - Connect the MPU6050 via I2C.
   - Insert the SD card into the DFPlayer Mini.
   - Connect a small speaker to the DFPlayer Mini output.

2. **Upload Code**
   - Open the project folder in VS Code with PlatformIO or Arduino IDE.
   - Select the ESP32 board and correct COM port.
   - Upload the firmware.

3. **Run the Project**
   - Power on the ESP32 (via USB or battery).
   - Perform different hand gestures.
   - The ESP32 will recognize gestures using sensor data.
   - DFPlayer Mini will play the corresponding pre-recorded audio.

4. **Add New Gestures**
   - Update the gesture mapping logic in `main.cpp`.
   - Add new audio files (`.mp3`) to the SD card in sequential numbering (e.g., `0001.mp3`, `0002.mp3`).
   - Re-flash the code to include new mappings.

5. **Testing**
   - Open the Serial Monitor at 115200 baud rate.
   - Debug sensor readings and check recognized gestures.
```
```
## Results & Demo

### Results
- Successfully translates predefined hand gestures into corresponding audio outputs.  
- Flex sensors + MPU6050 data are processed in real-time by the ESP32.  
- DFPlayer Mini plays pre-recorded audio files with minimal delay.  
- System can be extended by adding more gestures and audio mappings.  
- Achieved smooth serial debugging and stable performance in lab tests.

## Future Work

- **Gesture Expansion**: Add more complex gesture combinations for a richer vocabulary.  
- **Dynamic Phrase Generation**: Integrate an ML model for real-time text-to-speech instead of fixed audio files.  
- **Miniaturization**: Design a compact, custom PCB to reduce size and improve portability.  
- **Wireless Connectivity**: Enable Bluetooth/Wi-Fi support for integration with smartphones or IoT devices.  
- **Energy Optimization**: Implement low-power modes for longer battery life.  
- **Multilingual Support**: Expand gesture-to-speech output across multiple languages.  
- **AI Integration**: Use advanced ML techniques (e.g., LSTM/RNN) for continuous gesture recognition.  
- **Cloud/Edge Support**: Store and update gesture mappings via a connected app or cloud server.  

## Troubleshooting

Here are some common issues and their solutions:

- **No audio output from DFPlayer Mini**  
  - Check if the SD card is properly formatted (FAT32).  
  - Ensure audio files are named correctly (e.g., `0001.mp3`, `0002.mp3`).  
  - Verify speaker connections and volume settings.  

- **ESP32 not detecting flex sensors**  
  - Recheck wiring of ADC pins.  
  - Calibrate sensor values in the code.  
  - Test with a multimeter to confirm sensor resistance changes.  

- **IMU (MPU6050) giving unstable readings**  
  - Ensure proper power supply (3.3V, not 5V).  
  - Add a small delay/filtering in code to stabilize readings.  
  - Check I2C connections (SDA, SCL).  

- **Code not compiling**  
  - Verify required libraries are installed (`DFRobotDFPlayerMini`, `Wire`, etc.).  
  - Ensure correct board and COM port are selected in Arduino IDE.  

- **Gestures not recognized correctly**  
  - Increase training data for the ML model.  
  - Adjust threshold values in the code.  
  - Check if flex sensors are securely attached to fingers.
